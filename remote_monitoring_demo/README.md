# Kruize Remote Monitoring Demo

## Goal
The goal of this demo is to demonstrate the workflow of Kruize in Remote monitoring mode and project the recommendations generated by kruize on grafana dashboard. The [demo](./demo.py)  script creates experiments using the [Kruize Remote Monitoring REST APIs](https://github.com/kruize/autotune/tree/mvp_demo/design/MonitoringModeAPI.md) for the specified deployment in a namespace and updates the results containing the resource usage metrics for the deployment. It then fetches and displays the Kruize recommendations for each of the experiments created.

## Steps
This demo does the following:
- Clones the required git repositories
- Installs minikube and prometheus
- Installs kruize and initializes the thanos and grafana containers
- Creates an experiment by posting the input json to Kruize Monitoring REST APIs, updates the results for the experiments and fetches the Kruize recommendations
- Metric results along with the recommendations are backfilled in thanos and launches grafana in the browser
- User can login to grafana and search for pronosana-dashboard to view the cpu and memory recommendations provided by Kruize

## Pre-req
It expects minikube to be installed with atleast 8 CPUs and 16384MB Memory.
**WARNING:** The script deletes any existing minikube cluster.

## How do I run it?

```
# Run the Kruize monitoring demo using the below command:
$ ./monitoring_demo.sh

Where values for demo.py are:
usage: ./monitoring_demo.sh [ -c ] : cluster type. Supported types - minikube, default is minikube
                            [ -o ] : Kruize docker image, optional
                            
# If you want to restart only kruize with the specified docker image
$ ./monitoring_demo.sh -r -o [kruize image]

# To terminate the demo
$ ./monitoring_demo.sh -t
